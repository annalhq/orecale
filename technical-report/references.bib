	ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increasingly proven to be flexible tools for mapping mine terrain, offering expedient and precise data compared to alternatives. Photogrammetric outputs are particularly beneficial in open pit operations and waste dump areas, since they enable cost-effective and reproducible digital terrain models. Meanwhile, UAV-based LiDAR has proven invaluable in situations where uniform ground surfaces, dense vegetation, or steep slopes challenge purely photogrammetric solutions. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have further enhanced the capacity to distinguish critical features, such as vegetation and fractured rock surfaces, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents and ecological damage. Nevertheless, scientific gaps remain to be researched. Standardization around flight practices, sensor selection, and data verification persists as elusive, and most mining sites still rely on limited, multi-temporal surveys that may not capture sudden changes in slope conditions. Complexity lies in devising strategies for rehabilitated dumps, where post-mining restoration efforts involve vegetation regrowth, erosion mitigation, and altered land use. Through expanded sensor integration and refined automated analysis, approaches could shift from information gathering to ongoing hazard assessment and environmental surveillance. This evolution would improve both safety and environmental stewardship, reflecting the emerging role of UAVs in advancing a more sustainable future for mining.},

	ABSTRACT = {The Markland test is one of the most diffused and adopted methods of kinematic analysis for the identification of critical intersections of rock discontinuities that could generate rock failures. Traditionally, the kinematic analysis is based on the use of a stereographic approach that is able to identify the critical combination between the orientations of discontinuities and the rock wall. The recent improvements in the use of Digital Outcrop Models (DOMs) created the conditions for the development of a new automatized approach. We present ROck Slope Kinematic Analysis (ROKA) which is an open-source algorithm aimed at performing the Kinematic Analysis using the discontinuity measures collected onto a 3D DOM. The presented algorithm is able to make a local identification of the possible critical combination between the identified discontinuities and the orientation of the slope. Using this approach, the algorithm is able to identify on the slope the presence of critical combinations according to the traditional kinematic analysis of planar failure, flexural toppling, wedge failure, and direct toppling modes of failures and then visualize them on DOMs. In this way, the traditional approach is more effective and can be adopted for a more detailed analysis of large and complex areas.},
